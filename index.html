    <section class="container about-me">
        <h2>I'm a software engineer based in Los Angeles, originally from New York.</h2>
        <p>With a background in healthtech, I've spent most of my career designing innovative electronic medical record software for long-term care facilities.</p>
        <p>I love the creative side of building websites and web apps, especially when it comes to user interfaces.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I'm a dad joke enthusiast, an electric bass player (not a guitarist!), and a fan of live shows—from experimental jazz to extreme metal. I'm also a foodie exploring LA's vibrant scene, though I miss the tastes of NY. When I'm not coding, you might find me diving into a good sci-fi novel or attempting a 5k.</p>
